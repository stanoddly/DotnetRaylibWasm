[GitHub Pages Demo](https://stanoddly.github.io/DotnetRaylibWasm/)

This is a fully working prototype for .NET 8 with Raylib ahead-of-time ðŸš€ compiled into WebAssembly (wasm). See a couple of [known issues](https://github.com/disketteman/DotnetRaylibWasm/issues) for limitations.

## Local setup

Make sure you have the latest version of .NET 8 for example from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0), the prototype was built with:
```
dotnet --version
8.0.200
```

Install the official wasm tooling:

```
dotnet workload install wasm-tools
dotnet workload install wasm-experimental
```

Install a tool to create ad-hoc http server to server `application/wasm`:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-serve
```

`libraylib.a` included in the repository is pre-compiled from my machine, but GitHub Pages workflow [compiles Raylib form PLATFORM=WEB](https://github.com/disketteman/DotnetRaylibWasm/blob/main/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml#L33) on its own every build.

## Overview

Examples are copied from [ChrisDill/Raylib-cs-Examples](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs-Examples). Few examples were removed since they used functionality removed from Raylib 4.2. This project uses 4.2.0.2 of the `Raylib-cs` nuget package.

```
./Examples
```

The project which makes the WebAssembly possible is here:
```
./DotnetRaylibWasm
```

## Run it

> **Note**
> The latest version of main branch is available [here](https://disketteman.github.io/DotnetRaylibWasm/). To run it locally follow these instructions.

`publish` the solution from the root of the repository. Don't even try to use just `build`, [it's buggy](https://github.com/disketteman/DotnetRaylibWasm/issues/7#issuecomment-1356442508). Note the publishing takes a while:

```
dotnet publish -c Release
```

To serve the files use this command from the root (change `\` to `/` in file path if you are not on Windows):

```
dotnet serve --mime .wasm=application/wasm --mime .js=text/javascript --mime .json=application/json --directory DotnetRaylibWasm\bin\Debug\net8.0\browser-wasm\AppBundle\
```

Copy the link from the output and open it in your browser (tested on the latest Chrome).
